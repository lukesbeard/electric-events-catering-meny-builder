# Tripleseat Integration Error Investigation

## Background and Motivation
We are encountering an error when submitting data to Tripleseat. The error appears to be related to invalid time values when trying to format a date into ISO string format.

Additionally, we've identified a production issue where the form submission button appears to do nothing when clicked in the production environment.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
After reviewing the code, I've identified the issues:

1. Tripleseat Integration Error:
   - The error occurs in the `formatTripleseatDate` function (tripleseat-integration.js line 116) which is attempting to convert a date to ISO format.
   - The error message shows: "RangeError: Invalid time value" when calling `Date.toISOString()`.
   - The debug log shows "No event times provided, using delivery time + default duration undefined", which suggests that the `TRIPLESEAT_CONFIG.defaultEventDuration` value is undefined when it should be a number.
   - The function tries to create dates using the delivery date and time, and set a default duration for event end time.

2. Production Form Submission Issue:
   - The logs show that the form submission is triggered and the `sendOrderEmail` function is called
   - The code properly detects that it's in a production environment
   - However, there's no execution path in the code for production environments, only for development mode
   - As a result, the form submission silently fails in production because the code path to actually send the data is missing

The root causes appear to be:
1. For the Tripleseat error:
   - The code is trying to create a Date object with invalid or undefined data
   - When no event times are provided, it's trying to use a default duration which is potentially undefined
   - The resulting invalid Date object is causing the `toISOString()` method to throw a RangeError when formatting the date

2. For the production submission issue:
   - The sendOrderEmail function has code for development mode but was missing the logic for production environments
   - After checking isDevelopment && !forceSubmit, it had no else clause to handle production submissions

Looking at the code in the HTML files, I noticed that `scripts.js` is loaded in the head with `defer` attribute:
```html
<script src="scripts.js" defer></script>
```

But the Tripleseat configuration files are loaded at the end of the document:
```html
<!-- Tripleseat Integration -->
<script src="tripleseat-config.js"></script>
<script src="tripleseat-integration.js"></script>
```

This loading order means that `scripts.js` may be executing before the Tripleseat configuration is fully loaded. Even though `scripts.js` has the `defer` attribute, it might still execute before the Tripleseat scripts if they are dynamically added to the DOM.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Fix script loading order to ensure that the TRIPLESEAT_CONFIG object is properly loaded before it's used
2. Add validation for date objects before calling `toISOString()` in the `formatTripleseatDate` function
3. Add fallbacks for missing or invalid event times
4. Add production submission code to the sendOrderEmail function
5. Test the solution with different form inputs

## Project Status Board
- [x] Identify the problematic code in tripleseat-integration.js
- [x] Understand why a RangeError is occurring with date formatting
- [x] Determine why "No event times provided, using delivery time + default duration undefined" is happening
- [x] Implement a fix for the date handling issue
- [x] Identify why the form submission doesn't work in production
- [x] Implement a production submission path in sendOrderEmail function
- [ ] Test the solution

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
I've implemented fixes for both issues:

1. For the Tripleseat integration error:
   - Fixed the script loading order: Moved the Tripleseat integration scripts to the head of the document with the defer attribute, ensuring they load before scripts.js on all catering pages
   - Added validation in the formatTripleseatDate function to handle invalid dates
   - Added fallbacks for the defaultEventDuration in case it's undefined (set to 3 hours default)

2. For the production submission issue:
   - Added a code path for production mode (and forced development submissions) in the sendOrderEmail function
   - The new code creates a FormData object with the necessary fields and submits it to Web3Forms
   - Added Tripleseat integration to the production submission path
   - Added redirect to the thank-you page upon successful submission
   - Added proper error handling with user-friendly error messages

These changes should ensure that:
1. The TRIPLESEAT_CONFIG object is fully loaded before scripts.js tries to use it
2. Even if there's an issue with the date object, the code will gracefully handle it instead of throwing an error
3. If the defaultEventDuration is undefined for any reason, it will use a fallback value of 3 hours
4. Form submissions work properly in both development and production environments

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The fixes have been implemented. The next step is to test the solution to ensure it works properly. I recommend testing with different form inputs, especially:
1. Testing with event times provided vs. no event times provided
2. Testing on all three catering pages
3. Testing with valid and invalid dates to ensure the validation works
4. Testing in both development and production environments to verify that form submissions work properly in both contexts

## Lessons
- Date operations require careful validation before calling methods like toISOString()
- Always log and validate the input values when dealing with time/date conversions
- Debug logging helps to pinpoint where undefined values are causing errors
- Script loading order can cause subtle bugs when objects from one script are referenced in another
- Always add fallbacks for configuration values that might be undefined
- Add defensive programming techniques to handle potential undefined values and invalid dates
- Always include code paths for all environments (development, production) to ensure proper functionality in all contexts
- Add detailed logging to help diagnose issues in production
