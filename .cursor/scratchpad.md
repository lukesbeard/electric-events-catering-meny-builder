# Electric Events Catering Menu Builder Automated Testing

## Background and Motivation
The client wants to add automated testing for their Electric Events Catering Menu Builder website that performs the following tasks once every 2 days:
1. Tests form submission in Production, validating the flow but stopping short of sending actual emails or writing to Tripleseat
2. Tests Tripleseat API configuration to verify that data can be written correctly
3. Emails luke@electric-hospitality.com with details of what passed or failed

The testing should be simple and utilize the existing email system. The application is deployed on Vercel.

## NEW REQUEST: Clean URLs Without HTML Extensions

The client wants to remove the .html extensions from page URLs to create cleaner URLs, but without creating subdirectories for each page. The goal is to maintain a simple folder structure while having clean URLs like `/ladybird-catering` instead of `/ladybird-catering.html`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
Based on the current codebase exploration:
1. **No existing testing infrastructure**: The project doesn't have a formal testing framework set up yet. There's a `tests` directory but it appears to be empty.
2. **Form submission process**: 
   - The form data is submitted via API calls to Google Sheets and potentially Tripleseat
   - The email is sent using Web3Forms API
3. **Vercel deployment**: 
   - The application is deployed on Vercel, which offers serverless functions
   - Vercel supports cron jobs through their recent Cron API feature
4. **Existing functionality to leverage**:
   - There's already code for test submissions and mock API calls
   - The current system has validation and mock testing capabilities

## Key Challenges and Analysis for Clean URLs
1. **Static Site with HTML Files**: The current site appears to be a static site with direct HTML files.
2. **Vercel Platform**: The site is deployed on Vercel, which offers URL rewriting capabilities through the `rewrites` and `cleanUrls` configuration options.
3. **Simple Structure Requirement**: The client wants to maintain a simple folder structure.
4. **Internal Links**: All internal links in the HTML files likely reference the .html extensions and would need to be updated.

## Implementation Strategy for Clean URLs
There are two simple approaches to implement clean URLs on Vercel without changing the folder structure:

### Option 1: Use Vercel's Built-in `cleanUrls` Feature (RECOMMENDED)
Vercel offers a built-in configuration option called `cleanUrls` that automatically enables clean URLs. This is the simplest approach:

1. Update vercel.json to include:
```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true
}
```

This single setting will:
- Make `/ladybird-catering.html` accessible as `/ladybird-catering`
- Automatically redirect requests from `/ladybird-catering.html` to `/ladybird-catering`
- No need to create subdirectories

### Option 2: Custom Rewrites/Redirects
If more control is needed, we can manually implement rewrites:

1. Update vercel.json to include rewrites for each HTML file:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/ladybird-catering", "destination": "/ladybird-catering.html" },
    { "source": "/muchacho-catering", "destination": "/muchacho-catering.html" },
    { "source": "/the-dug-out-catering", "destination": "/the-dug-out-catering.html" },
    // Add rewrites for all HTML files...
  ]
}
```

## High-level Task Breakdown for Clean URLs
1. **Update Vercel Configuration**:
   - Modify vercel.json to add the `cleanUrls: true` option
   - This will automatically handle all clean URL mapping without manual rewrites

2. **Update Internal Links** (optional but recommended):
   - Identify all internal links across HTML files
   - Update links to remove .html extensions for consistency
   - This step isn't strictly necessary since Vercel will handle redirects, but it's cleaner

3. **Test All Navigation Paths**:
   - Verify that all pages are accessible without .html extensions
   - Test that form submissions work correctly
   - Verify that internal navigation functions properly

## Project Status Board for Clean URLs
- [ ] Update vercel.json with `cleanUrls: true` configuration
- [ ] Optionally: Update internal links in HTML files to remove .html extensions
- [ ] Deploy and test clean URLs in production
- [ ] Verify all navigation, forms, and redirects work correctly

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Set up test infrastructure**:
   - Create a package.json file to define dependencies and scripts
   - Add necessary testing dependencies (e.g., Jest, Playwright)
   - Configure GitHub Actions or Vercel Cron for scheduled runs

2. **Create end-to-end form submission test**:
   - Develop an automated test that fills and submits the catering form
   - Use a special parameter or flag to prevent actual submission to external systems
   - Validate that the form submission flow works correctly up to the point of external API calls

3. **Create Tripleseat API configuration test**:
   - Develop a test that validates Tripleseat API connectivity and configuration
   - Use mock data to verify that the API integration works correctly
   - Check that all required fields are correctly mapped

4. **Implement email reporting system**:
   - Set up a function to compile test results
   - Create an email template for test reports
   - Configure the email sending using the existing email infrastructure

5. **Configure scheduling**:
   - Set up the testing to run every 48 hours
   - Configure proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Ensure tests run in Production environment but don't affect actual data

6. **Document the testing process**:
   - Update README with information about the automated testing
   - Add documentation for maintaining and extending the tests

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create package.json file with required dependencies
- [x] Set up testing framework 
- [x] Create form submission test
- [x] Create Tripleseat API test
- [x] Implement email reporting
- [x] Configure scheduled runs
- [x] Test the entire system
- [x] Update documentation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
I've implemented the automated testing system with the following components:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created package.json with required dependencies (Jest, Playwright, Nodemailer)
   - Set up Playwright configuration for end-to-end testing
   - Configured Jest for API testing

2. **End-to-End Form Submission Test**:
   - Implemented tests for all three catering forms (Ladybird, Muchacho, Dug-Out)
   - Set up special parameters to prevent actual submission to external systems
   - Added validation to ensure the form submission flow works correctly

3. **Tripleseat API Configuration Test**:
   - Created tests to validate Tripleseat API connectivity
   - Added tests to check venue IDs and configuration

4. **Email Reporting System**:
   - Implemented a system to compile test results
   - Created HTML email templates for test reports
   - Configured email sending using Web3Forms API

5. **Scheduling**:
   - Set up Vercel cron job to run every 2 days (0 12 */2 * *)
   - Added error handling and reporting
   - Implemented a serverless function for running tests in production

6. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with information about the automated testing
   - Added setup instructions

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. After deployment, the system will automatically test the form submission flow and Tripleseat API every 2 days and send email reports to the administrator.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The implementation is complete. Here are a few notes for the user:

1. To make this live, you'll need to deploy these changes to Vercel:
   - The cron job is configured in vercel.json
   - The serverless function is in api/health-check.js
   - Make sure to add any required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

2. You may want to test the health check manually before relying on the cron job:
   - Visit https://your-domain.com/api/health-check?sendEmail=true
   - This will run the health check and send a test email report

3. The E2E tests require a browser environment, which is not available in Vercel's serverless functions. That's why the serverless function performs simpler checks (loading the page and testing the API) while the full E2E testing is available for local/CI testing.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read files before attempting to edit them.
- Run npm audit before proceeding if vulnerabilities appear in the terminal.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
